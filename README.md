# Complex-Password-Generator
# Password Generator

## Description
**The PyPassword Generator** is a Python script that effortlessly crafts strong and secure passwords by blending a random mix of letters, symbols, and numbers based on the user's input. It's tailored to generate passwords that adhere to robust security standards, perfect for safeguarding a variety of accounts.

Through an intuitive command-line interface, users can specify the amount of each character type they desire in their password. The script assembles a password by choosing characters from predetermined lists, and further enhances security by randomizing the order of characters. This ensures the passwords generated are non-sequential and complex, significantly reducing the likelihood of breach through brute force or other common attacks.

## How It Works
1. **User Interaction**: Users input their desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers into the generator.
2. **Random Character Selection**: The script randomly selects characters from a set pool, ensuring a varied and unpredictable password composition.
3. **Character Shuffling**: The sequence of characters is shuffled to further complicate pattern recognition.
4. **Password Display**: The final, randomized password is presented to the user.

## Language Utilized
- **Python**: The entirety of the script is developed in Python with the standard `random` module to facilitate the randomness necessary for secure password generation.


## Example of Generated Password
